We are creating a simulation of a Rugby game, which will take input from the user to detail two team names, their offensive and defensive ratings, and will return a final score based on given points of calculation.

Each game consists of two teams, playing for a total of 80 minutes. Each team typically has an averave of 10 posessions within the given game time. Upon scoring a "Try" (worth five points) a team is then given a chance to score an additional "Conversion" (worth two points). Teams may alternatively score through means of "Penalties" (worth 3 points) and through means of "Drop Goals" (worth three points).

At the end of 80 minutes, the team with the most points will win the match.
